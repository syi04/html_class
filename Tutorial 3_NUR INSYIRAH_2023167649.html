She is the self-proclaimed doppelgänger rival of My Melody. Kuromi is a white rabbit with a black devil-like tail and wears a black jester's hat with a pink skull that changes its expression to match her mood.Kuromi is the leader of a biker gang known as "Kuromi's 5." Other members include a purple cat named Nyanmi, a pale orange dog named Wanmi, a white fox named Konmi, and a grey and white rat named Chumi. They all wear black and drive around in a menacing fashion. They love riding their tricycles and causing havoc at breakneck speeds, similar to the yakuza-inspired "bosozoku" girl gang subculture in Japan.</p>

	<P style="background-color: hotpink;"> Life brings us as many joyful moments as it does downfalls, and although there are days we wish there was a manual to follow, it simply wouldn’t be the same without the spontaneity. The journey of life may not become easier as we grow older, but we do seem to understand it better as our perspectives evolve.</P>
